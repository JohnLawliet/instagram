    -   necessary for custom styling    
-   require('tailwind-scrollbar')
    -   changes scrollbar view
    -   require('tailwind-scrollbar-hide')


new css:
-   <img className="h-14 w-14 p-[1.5px] border-red-500 border-2" />
    -   notice the use of padding to give a white gap to the image and then addition of border

-   <div className="relative mt-1 p-3 rounded-md">
        <div className="absolute inset-y-0 pl-3 flex items-center cursor-pointer">
            <SearchIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-500"/>
        </div>
        <input 
            type="text"
            placeholder="Search"
            className="bg-gray-50 block pl-10 w-full rounded-md border-gray-100 focus:ring-black focus:border-black sm:text-sm"
        />
    </div>  
    -   This is the searchbar
    -   notice use of absolute with relative to place icon in the bar and then addition of pl-5 to push the input bar due to fixed width i.e 100%

ISSUES WITH useSession object:
-   when in dev env, it is possible that the images might not be properly loaded due to rate limiter. Getting requests from a source multiple times frequently makes nextjs think of it as a sham. THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR IN HTTPS
